# My Dev Handbook

A personal knowledge base documenting my understanding of software engineering concepts â€” from **DevOps pipelines** to **frontend frameworks**, **web3**, and **backend architecture**.

This repository serves as:
- A structured space to organize my learnings and references.
- A quick-reference guide for concepts I revisit often.
- A public record of my continuous learning journey.
