### 1. CI vs CD (clear mental separation)
#### CI (Continuous Integration)
- Code → Build → Test → Package (artifact).
- This happens often (every PR, every push).

#### CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) = shipping the car to dealerships.
- Take the package (artifact) → deliver to staging/prod → customers use it.
- This happens less frequently, and with approvals.

👉 CI = correctness + readiness. CD = safe delivery.

### 2. What is an Artifact?
Artifact is a build output that’s versioned, reusable, and deployable.

In Azure, artifacts are stored in **pipeline artifacts** or **Azure Artifacts (feed)**.
- **Pipeline artifacts** are accessible only between the stages of the pipeline.
- **Feed artifact** is accessible in general (if the user have permission to access it).

Artifact can be used to promote **Build Once, Deploy Many** philosophy.

### 3. Why “Build Once, Deploy Many”?
- If you rebuild for each environment, you risk mismatches (dev build ≠ prod build).
- Instead:
  - Build once → generate artifact.
  - Pass environment configs at deploy time (not at build time).
    
👉 This ensures **consistency**.

### 4. Environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- Think of it like **gates in a castle**:
  - Dev = playground (engineers can break things).
  - Staging/UAT = pre-prod, QA tests, product managers validate.
  - Prod = real users, real money — requires approvals and monitoring.

In Azure:
- Each environment can have approvers.
- Pipelines can say:
  - Build → auto deploy to Dev.
  - Deploy to Staging → requires QA approval.
  - Deploy to Prod → requires Release Manager approval.

👉 This is how enterprises stay safe while moving fast.
